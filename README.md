# GitCaseStudy

Everything but paggination was done.

● show a list of repositories on Github belonging to member “google”
● the users must be able to browse through all repositories in a list
● the users must not wait until all repositories have been fetched from API. They
should be able to browse through as quick as possible at minimum waiting
time
● each item in the list displays title, language and number of watchers
● touching on an item in the list, the user can see the details of the repository,
including title, description, login name and repository update date. The details
should be opened in a different screen than the main list screen.
